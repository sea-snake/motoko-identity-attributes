/// Single-use canister-issued nonces, held in a `Map<Blob, Int>` keyed
/// by nonce bytes with the issue timestamp as the value.
///
/// ## Why nonces are canister-issued
///
/// Internet Identity's attribute-bundle protocol bakes the nonce into
/// the signed bundle so the relying-party canister can prove "I started
/// this flow". A frontend-generated nonce gives the canister no way to
/// distinguish a fresh user flow from an attacker replaying or
/// laundering an old bundle. Mint here, store here, consume here.
///
/// ## Pruning
///
/// `issue` and `consume` both drop entries older than `expiryNs` before
/// touching the store, so memory stays bounded even if no one calls
/// `consume`. On top of that, `issue` evicts the oldest entry when the
/// store is already at `maxTotal` — protects against a runaway frontend
/// minting nonces but never using them.
///
/// The lib doesn't refuse a `consume` on an expired entry — the entry
/// is gone by then and the call returns `#UnknownNonce`, which is what
/// the consumer wants anyway. The bundle's own
/// `implicit:issued_at_timestamp_ns` freshness check in `Verify` is
/// the authoritative stale-bundle gate.
///
/// ## Upgrade behavior
///
/// The store lives inside the `transient` `IdentityAttributesProvider`,
/// so it's recreated empty on every upgrade. In-flight authentications
/// will just need to retry — the `expiryNs` window means anything that
/// would have been redeemable was about to time out anyway.
///
/// ## Why we don't key by `Principal`
///
/// In the canonical flow the begin endpoint is called anonymously
/// (before Internet Identity sign-in) and the finish endpoint is called
/// authenticated, so the two callers differ. Cross-user replay is
/// handled by the bundle signature itself: the IC binds the bundle to
/// the caller of the finish endpoint, so an attacker who steals a
/// nonce only manages to register themselves.
